As a community, we are deeply impacted by these tragedies and the reminder they bring of the social injustice that exists in the world and in the Rice community.\n\nWe strive to raise awareness for these injustices and are dedicated to starting within our residential college. We write this to state that Duncan is committed to creating an environment that values and supports our Black Duncaroos. We are challenging our non-Black Duncaroos to commit to being anti-racist, inclusive, and unwavering in their allyship. We will have zero tolerance for discrimination and will make efforts to amplify Black voices and encourage inclusivity.\n\nWe understand that this burden is not for Black Americans to take alone. We stand in active solidarity with the Black community. We realize that many of our fellow Black Duncaroos are grieving and exhausted from taking on this fight alone. It is up to us to stand with our peers and promise to extend allyship beyond our words. With this in mind, we have included a thorough list of resources to do that. We encourage you to review all contents of this document. We understand the work that it will take to fix the problems of racism in this country, but we also understand that change starts with action. This document is full of ways to actively support the Black community and improve allyship through education, voting, signing petitions and much more.\n\nTo be silent is to be complicit, and we as a college will not stay silent on issues that affect our family and the Black community.\n\nSomos Equipos, Somos Familia</string>
